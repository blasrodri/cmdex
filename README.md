# Command Example (WIP)

This project is an attempt to simplify the life of those users needing some
help when using a command they're unfamiliar with. Instead of having to go to a web engine
or a QA website, just query it here.

## Goals
- CLI Support 
- HTTP Support 
- Fuzzy search
- User voting the effectiveness of an example
